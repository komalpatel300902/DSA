**Basic Operations**   

Total There are 12 operation :  

`Traversal` , `Insertion`, `Deletion`, `Search`,` Reverse`,` Sorting`,` Merge`,` Split`, `Find Length`, `Detect Loop`, `Find Duplicate`, `Find Middle Element`.
#### Traversal
Visiting each node in the linked list in order.
Example: Printing the elements of the list.

#### Insertion
At the beginning: Adding a new node at the start of the list.
At the end: Adding a new node at the end of the list.
At a given position: Adding a new node at a specific position in the list.

#### Deletion
From the beginning: Removing the first node of the list.
From the end: Removing the last node of the list.
From a given position: Removing a node from a specific position in the list.

#### Search
Finding a node with a specific value.
Example: Searching for a node containing a particular data value.

**Advanced Operations**
#### Reverse
Reversing the order of the nodes in the linked list.

#### Sorting
Arranging the nodes in the linked list in a particular order (e.g., ascending or descending).

#### Merge
Combining two linked lists into one.

#### Split
Dividing a linked list into two or more smaller linked lists.

#### Find Length
Counting the number of nodes in the linked list.

#### Detect Loop
Checking if the linked list contains a cycle or loop.

#### Remove Duplicates
Eliminating duplicate values from the linked list.

#### Find Middle Element
Identifying the middle node in the linked list.
